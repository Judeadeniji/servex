   - Develop basic plugins (e.g., JSX Renderer, Logger, Static File Serving, Database Integrations).

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Start writing initial documentation.
   - Provide basic usage examples and guides.
   - Develop tutorials and how-to guides for common use cases.

4. **Internal Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for core features.
   - Begin internal testing to identify and fix critical bugs.

## Months 7-12: Alpha Phase (0.0.1_alpha)

1. **Feature Completion**
   - Complete the implementation of all planned features and plugins.
   - Ensure thorough testing and validation of each feature.

2. **Stability and Performance**
   - Optimize performance and enhance stability.
   - Conduct stress testing and profiling.

3. **Expanded Documentation**
   - Update and expand documentation with more detailed guides and examples.
   - Create advanced tutorials and comprehensive how-to guides.

4. **Community Involvement**
   - Begin sharing the project with a limited audience for feedback.
   - Engage early adopters and gather feedback to improve the framework.

5. **Final Preparations for Alpha Release**
   - Finalize all documentation, including API references and advanced guides.
   - Prepare marketing materials, blog posts, and launch announcements.
   - Conduct a final round of testing and bug fixing.
